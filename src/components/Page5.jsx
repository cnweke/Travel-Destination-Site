       <h3><b>Were the frameworks difficult to install:</b></h3>
       
       <ul>
           <li>React and Node.js: Not at all, practically the same steps to install both frameworks with little difference in React.</li>
       </ul>

       <h3><b><p>Was it easy to create pages with it?</p></b></h3>
       <ul>
            <li>Far easier than expected, react especially made development faster and more productive with the ability to use routes. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3><b><p>Was the learning curve steep compared with regular HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP?</p></b></h3>
       <ul>
            <li>The learning curve was smooth and knowledge gained from HTML/CSS/Javascript were easily transferrable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><b><p>Would i have done anything differently?</p></b></h3>
       <ul>
            <li>I wouldn't have done anything different at all, No regrets whatsoever the project went seamless. React is the GOAT frontend framework.</li>
        </ul>
